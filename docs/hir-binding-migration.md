# HIR binding migration

## Goal

Replace the planner-era semantic binder with an analyzer that produces closed,
validated HIR directly. Preserve SQLite binding rules, diagnostics, and test
coverage while replacing old data structures.

Do not make `BindScope` own a `HirDocument`. One `Analyzer` owns the document
arenas. Temporary scopes contain document-local IDs and small lookup facts.
They do not contain planner nodes, mutable AST, runtime registers, or cloned
documents.

## Design mapping

| Old binding concept | HIR design |
|---|---|
| `BindContext` | `Analyzer` owning document arenas |
| `BindScope` | Temporary name-resolution structure |
| `ScopeTable` / `TableInternalId` | `ScopeSource` / `SourceId` |
| Bound alias expression | `OutputId` plus resolved expression facts |
| `BoundSelect` / `BoundSubquery` | `Query`, `QueryBlock`, and `Source` |
| `BindTracking` | Required-column worklist; calculate captures afterward |
| Cloned CTE AST | Lazy CTE state with reserved `CteId` |
| `allow_unbound` | Register sources before resolving expressions |
| `right_join_swapped` | Preserve RIGHT/FULL joins in HIR |
| Trigger registers | NEW/OLD/EXCLUDED pseudo-sources |
| `ProgramBuilder` labels/registers | Physical lowering only |

## Migration order

1. Port `SemanticContext`, analyzer arenas, HIR scope, and expression analysis.
2. Move SELECT vertically: sources -> expressions -> joins -> outputs -> compounds.
3. Add lazy CTE handling and correlation calculation.
4. Move INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and pseudo-sources.
5. Move triggers and stored schema expressions.
6. Validate every completed document.
7. Feed resolved HIR into the existing plan, optimizer, and emitter pipeline.
8. Switch the production entry point after coverage is complete.
9. Delete `Bound*`, source-ID conversion, and planner-era binding code.

## Planner handoff

Keep the existing plan algorithms, optimizer, and emitter. Replace only work
already completed by semantic analysis:

- Build existing planning source records from resolved HIR sources.
- Move SELECT plan expressions from parser AST to resolved HIR expressions.
- Assemble existing SELECT plans from HIR without name lookup, star expansion,
  alias or ordinal replacement, function lookup, or expression rewriting.
- Switch SELECT preparation to HIR in one step; do not run both binders.
- Remove the name-resolution half of `TableReferences`, keeping column usage,
  join planning, index selection, and other physical planning data.

Do not convert HIR expressions back into parser AST. That would discard
resolved function, type, collation, and comparison choices, forcing later
stages to repeat semantic work.

HIR planned sources keep their document-local `SourceId` directly. They do not
allocate a `TableInternalId` or maintain a compatibility map. IDs for
planner-created runtime objects may remain separate.

## Current status

Core SELECT and top-level DML binding are present. The user-visible SELECT
coverage audit is complete; deferred migration work remains below.

### Remaining binding coverage audit

This audit compared every remaining semantic catch-all with parser AST shapes,
the PR #8111 binder, the current planner and expression translator, and existing
conformance tests. The temporary copy of the PR binder was removed after the
audit completed. A generic `unsupported SELECT statement` error is not evidence
that the old path rejects the same SQL.

No audited user-visible SELECT binding gaps remain.

Deferred migration surfaces:

| Surface | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| Production entry point and whole-query lowering | Statement and whole-trigger-program inputs produce validated HIR from an owned multi-database semantic catalog. Standalone HIR expression lowering is now being ported in narrow checkpoints, but preparation still enters the legacy plan and emitter path. |

### Cutover deletion map

SELECT has no remaining HIR planning guard. Its planner handoff does not use a
resolver, `TableReferences`, parser-expression conversion, binding, or
rewriting. Remaining parser types are frozen enums and literals already owned
by HIR.

| Legacy work | HIR replacement | Why still live |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT binding in `select.rs` | Semantic analyzer and HIR | Production preparation still builds the legacy plan. |
| `expr/binding.rs` | `semantic/expr.rs` | The legacy emitter still consumes parser expressions. |
| `TableReferences` name lookup | Semantic `Scope` and `SourceId` | Legacy SELECT and DML callers still use it. |
| `TableReferences` physical facts | HIR planned sources and loops | The legacy emitter still uses its cursor and ordering metadata. |
| Bind and rewrite passes | Closed, validated HIR | Production cutover has not happened. |

Preserved binding restrictions, not HIR gaps:

| Restriction | Matching old-path evidence |
|---|---|
| RIGHT JOIN after an earlier join | Same diagnostic in planner and archived binder. |
| Aggregate or window functions in a recursive CTE arm | Same planner rejection. |
| DISTINCT windows, aggregate argument ORDER BY for windows, unsupported ordered-set forms, and moving-start `array_agg` windows | Same planner restrictions and diagnostics. |
| UPDATE or DELETE of WITHOUT ROWID tables | Same statement-entrypoint rejection. |
| Subqueries in UPSERT conflict targets and DO UPDATE expressions | Same archived-binder and expression-translator rejection. |
| UPSERT or non-VALUES sources for virtual-table INSERT | Current virtual-table INSERT emitter only accepts VALUES or DEFAULT VALUES. |

Internal or already-normalized parser nodes are not new SQL coverage:

- Non-SELF `Expr::Column` and `Expr::RowId`, `Expr::Register`, and
  `Expr::SubqueryResult` are products of old binding, planning, or emission.
- `Expr::Default` is consumed by INSERT/UPDATE destination binding before
  ordinary expression analysis.
- `Func::AlterTable` is created by ALTER TABLE translation, not by a SELECT
  function call.

### Non-lowering phase complete

Validated HIR and HIR access planning now cover query roots, INSERT-owned
queries, top-level UPDATE and DELETE, and ordered trigger commands.

No legacy binding code is safely deletable before production cutover.
`translate_inner` still enters the AST plan builders, and the current emitter
still consumes parser expressions, `Plan`, and `TableReferences`.

The next phase must replace that production handoff. Only then can we delete:

- SELECT binding and rewriting in `select.rs`
- DML binding and rewriting in `insert.rs`, `update.rs`, and `delete.rs`
- `expr/binding.rs`
- name-resolution state and methods from `TableReferences`
- parser-expression fields retained solely by legacy plans

This boundary must not be crossed by running HIR and legacy planning together,
or by converting HIR expressions back into parser AST.

Completed:

- HIR output references now read an already-evaluated register bound by
  `OutputId` in `ProgramBuilder`. Expression lowering never follows the output
  expression or evaluates volatile output expressions again; whole-query
  lowering will establish and clear these bindings around each query block.
- Aggregate and window result reads now use their stable HIR identities to
  find the result registers owned by `ProgramBuilder`. This replaces the
  legacy structural expression cache while preserving its unconditional copy
  and avoiding a second evaluation of arguments or filters.
- Scalar, row-value, and EXISTS subqueries now read runtime results through a
  `QueryId`-keyed binding in `ProgramBuilder`. Row widths are checked against
  the validated HIR query output, and row copies reuse the legacy target-range
  invariant instead of converting the subquery back into parser AST.
- Standalone HIR expression lowering now consumes frozen custom-column,
  custom-CAST, and custom-binary-operator programs directly. Custom binary
  calls preserve legacy operand swapping, literal encoding, result negation,
  and target-copy behavior while calling the exact function resolved by
  semantic analysis. No resolver, parser expression, or `TableReferences`
  lookup enters these paths.
- Merged USING/NATURAL columns now own resolved expressions for both sides.
  LEFT and RIGHT joins lower only the selected value; FULL joins short-circuit
  the same target register across both values. Validation still checks both
  owned expressions and requires the right side to retain a source-column
  identity.
- Trigger predicates and commands now have ordered HIR planner roots. SELECT
  commands retain their `QueryId`; UPDATE and DELETE commands reuse resolved
  target access planning without turning trigger OLD/NEW pseudo-sources into
  physical scans.
- Top-level DELETE now uses resolved HIR for target access selection. Its
  predicate, index hint, column-use counts, and target `SourceId` flow directly
  into the shared access planner without `TableReferences`, binding, rewriting,
  or parser-expression conversion.
- Top-level UPDATE now uses resolved HIR for target and `FROM` access selection.
  The NEW-row pseudo-source remains semantic write state and never becomes a
  physical scan source.
- HIR planning now starts from the owned document rather than a caller-supplied
  query ID. Query, DML, and trigger roots plan every reachable query once, while
  documents without query work produce an empty query-plan list.
- Parenthesized FROM groups now pass through complete HIR access planning.
  Outer-join predicates owned by a group become ready only when the current
  physical leaf completes that group, including nested and single-leaf groups;
  they remain residual predicates rather than unsafe leaf access constraints.
- HIR planner input now walks parenthesized FROM groups recursively. Physical
  leaves stay flat for the existing join planner, while nested group ranges,
  parent boundaries, join kinds, and outer-join predicate ownership remain
  explicit without a fake group cursor or a copied join tree.
- Greedy HIR join ordering now accepts those group boundaries. Constrained
  groups wait for their left side, nested prerequisites cannot deadlock an
  active parent group, and a started group finishes before planning continues
  outside it. Access selection still operates on the same flat physical leaves.
- HIR constraint and predicate masks now use one flat FROM layout instead of
  searching only the top-level semantic FROM list. Group leaves map to their
  physical positions, while nested RIGHT and FULL null extension stays local
  to the parenthesized group that owns the join.
- Temporary scope columns are now named and stored as expression bindings.
  Parenthesized FROM-group names resolve directly to their inner HIR column or
  merged-column expression, so the group source is only join structure and
  never becomes a fake runtime column source.
- Table-valued function calls now freeze hidden-column argument predicates in
  HIR. NULL uses `IS NULL`; other arguments use ordinary resolved equality
  semantics. HIR planning consumes those predicates with existing outer-join
  ownership and virtual-table access selection, without parser-expression
  rebinding.
- Expression subqueries now participate in HIR query dependency planning.
  Scalar, row, EXISTS, and IN subqueries are planned before their owning query
  through the iterative HIR expression walker; their resolved expression shape
  and comparison rules remain in the semantic document.
- Recursive CTE seed and arm queries now plan before their owner. The outer
  recursive source and each occurrence-local queue input retain `CteId`
  directly; queue ordering, comparison collations, compound operators, and
  LIMIT remain owned by HIR without a fake table identity or legacy recursive
  plan.
- HIR planning now resolves non-recursive CTE materialization into explicit
  `PerReference`, `Shared`, or `Explicit` policy. Reference counting stops at
  CTE-body boundaries, outer captures prevent sharing, and `NOT MATERIALIZED`
  keeps the legacy behavior of allowing safe multi-reference sharing.
- Non-recursive CTE sources now retain their `CteId`, body `QueryId`, and
  materialization choice in HIR planning. The body is planned before each
  referencing query block, and CTE scans reuse the resolved query-backed
  constraint, cardinality, and cost path without synthetic legacy subquery
  tables.
- Derived-query scans now collect resolved binary and `IN` constraints through
  the same HIR extractor as B-tree sources. They use child-query row estimates
  for generic filter selectivity but cannot produce index or automatic-index
  candidates.
- One HIR join input now represents physical B-tree and derived-query sources
  explicitly. Mixed joins use the same greedy ordering, connectivity,
  cross-product, and predicate-work loop; derived scans compete using their
  child row and cost estimates without a synthetic `FromClauseSubquery`.
- Derived `FROM` sources now retain their child `QueryId` in the final source
  loop. Query planning visits the child first, then uses its output cardinality
  and cost with the existing coroutine-scan formula; no legacy
  `FromClauseSubquery`, AST conversion, resolver, or `TableReferences` enters
  this path.
- Compound SELECT arms now receive HIR access plans while their final ORDER BY
  remains query-level. Operators, arm IDs, ordering, and limits stay in the
  owned semantic document instead of being copied into another query shape.
- Ordinary SELECT and VALUES queries now have an owned HIR query-plan entry
  point. The plan retains the semantic document and plans its blocks directly
  from document-local query and source identities.
- Query-block planning derives column-use counts from the owning resolved HIR
  query. Callers no longer build or pass a separate usage summary.
- Query-block planning now has one resolved-HIR entry point that owns planner
  scratch construction. Source-less SELECT and VALUES blocks produce empty-loop
  plans while retaining predicates, cardinality, and zero access cost.
- Final HIR B-tree plans own their predicates after access selection, including
  consumption state. Residual filters therefore survive planning instead of
  remaining in mutable caller scratch state.
- HIR planned sources no longer clone source names, aliases, or USING column
  names into parser-era planner fields. The HIR document remains their owner;
  physical join planning keeps only the resolved join kind.
- Final HIR B-tree plans retain only selected loops, output cardinality, and
  cost. Constraint arenas, candidate access methods, and dynamic-programming
  join state stay local to planning and are dropped at the handoff boundary.
- HIR planned sources no longer carry a placeholder legacy `Operation`.
  Selected HIR access lives only on the final planned loop; parser-expression
  sources retain their existing operation field through the shared source
  type's default parameter.
- Selected B-tree access methods now pass through one representation-generic
  application path. Legacy AST and HIR planning share automatic-index
  materialization, scan/seek/rowid/IN construction, and predicate-consumption
  rules; only expression extraction differs.
- Automatic-index construction now consumes a generic planned source. HIR
  supplies its resolved source identity, physical table, and frozen column-use
  mask directly; building the index no longer requires `JoinedTable`.
- Seek construction now shares the existing direction, range, equality, and
  NULL-boundary algorithm across parser and HIR expressions. HIR extracts seek
  values and frozen comparison affinity directly from resolved predicates;
  resolver and `TableReferences` are absent from that entry point.
- Seek definitions, keys, and range constraints now accept either parser or
  HIR expressions. The legacy plan keeps parser expressions through default
  type parameters, while HIR planning can keep resolved expressions without
  changing physical lowering.
- HIR query-block B-tree planning now has one boundary that collects resolved
  constraints, derives ANALYZE row estimates, owns the access-method arena, and
  returns the complete `JoinN`. Callers no longer assemble those planning steps
  themselves, and the boundary uses no AST, resolver, or `TableReferences`.
- Greedy HIR B-tree planning now builds a complete left-deep `JoinN`. It uses
  the existing ordering restrictions, connected-source preference,
  cross-product penalty, cardinality formula, and access-method arena without
  converting resolved expressions back to parser expressions.
- HIR B-tree join-step selection now accepts the mask of sources already
  joined. Later sources can therefore use resolved join constraints for index
  seeks and automatic indexes; complete HIR join planning supplies an empty
  left-hand side for its chosen starting source.
- Greedy HIR planning selects the starting source and every ordinary B-tree
  access method through one complete-plan entry point. The temporary public
  first-step scaffold has been removed.
- Ready-predicate masks, loop ownership, and residual expression work now flow
  through one representation-neutral join helper. HIR derives the inputs from
  resolved source dependencies and its iterative expression walker; only the
  legacy hash-join metadata still depends on parser expressions.
- Ordinary indexes, automatic temporary indexes, and `IN` seeks now compete in
  one source-generic B-tree selector. The legacy wrapper retains only AST-based
  multi-index scans; HIR uses the same single-source cost and replacement logic.
- `IN`-seek selection now returns the final planner `AccessMethod` through one
  expression-representation-neutral entry point. Legacy and HIR paths share
  consumed predicates, affinity, index identity, row estimates, and cost.
- Ordinary B-tree access selection now has one source-generic entry point that
  both chooses the candidate and builds its planner `AccessMethod`. Legacy and
  HIR callers no longer need representation-specific glue between those steps.
- Chosen B-tree candidates now become planner access methods through one
  expression-representation-neutral builder. Legacy and HIR constraints share
  covering, rows-per-seek, consumed-predicate, direction, and index facts.
- Partial-index candidates now retain the query predicate terms that proved
  them usable. Ordinary B-tree and `IN` access selection consume those frozen
  term positions instead of rebinding and rewriting the schema predicate after
  choosing an index.
- B-tree candidate scoring now runs one loop for legacy and HIR constraints.
  Source-specific order matching sits behind a small source trait; HIR keeps
  resolved source IDs and borrowed expressions through index choice.
- HIR expressions now share one iterative frame traversal for preorder walks
  and postorder folds. Partial-index selectivity uses the fold directly instead
  of maintaining its own traversal tasks and result stack.
- Partial-index candidates now carry their estimated stored-row fraction.
  Legacy collection runs its existing bound-AST estimator once; HIR collection
  applies the same formulas iteratively to the frozen resolved predicate.
  Repeated candidate scoring no longer binds partial-index expressions or
  needs `AvailableIndexes` for this estimate.
- B-tree order matching now shares one source-generic algorithm across legacy
  and HIR planning. HIR compares computed order terms against frozen resolved
  index expressions, while preserving the existing equality-prefix,
  collation, direction, NULL-order, custom-type, and rowid rules without AST
  conversion or adapter allocation.
- HIR ORDER BY terms now build planner order targets directly from resolved
  source, output, collation, direction, and NULL-order facts. Output references
  are followed inside the frozen document and computed expressions stay
  borrowed; planning performs no name lookup, catalog lookup, AST conversion,
  or expression clone.
- Order-target storage is generic over source identity and expression
  representation. The legacy planner keeps its existing table IDs and AST
  pointers, while HIR can borrow resolved expressions keyed by `SourceId`
  without cloning or converting them back to parser nodes.
- Base row-count estimation now consumes a physical `Table` instead of a
  parser-era `JoinedTable`. HIR query-block sources therefore receive the same
  ANALYZE statistics and subquery fallbacks before join scoring, without a
  compatibility source or separate estimate implementation.
- Whole-block HIR sources and constraints now enter the shared greedy
  starting-source selector directly. The selector reads frozen source
  definitions lazily, allocates no compatibility source vector, and applies
  HIR RIGHT/FULL ordering restrictions before scoring.
- The HIR plan context now collects constraints for every query-block source
  from the already assembled HIR sources and predicates. Whole-block planning
  no longer needs callers to reconstruct the per-source constraint loop.
- `IN`-seek access selection now consumes the shared borrowed access-source
  view. HIR supplies its planned source plus frozen definition, so rowid/index
  choice, collation, affinity, covering, and cost rules remain one algorithm.
- Greedy starting-source scoring and directed indexed-seek benefits now consume
  generic constraints and an exact-size iterator of borrowed source views.
  HIR can run the same loop without building an adapter vector.
- Greedy join ordering now consumes the same `JoinOrderingRestrictions` used
  by exhaustive legacy and HIR planning. Starting-source eligibility,
  indexed-seek benefits, and later-source eligibility no longer rebuild a
  separate LEFT-only dependency map.
- Indexed-seek scoring consumes one borrowed source view for its physical
  table and covering-index decision. Legacy sources and HIR sources therefore
  use the same scoring call without per-call callbacks; HIR covering reads its
  frozen source definition.
- Covering-index required-column rules are shared by legacy and HIR planned
  sources. HIR expression-key matching reads frozen resolved index expressions;
  output, grouping, HAVING, and ORDER BY usage is registered directly from
  resolved source and column identities. Parser-expression matching remains
  only as a temporary legacy wrapper.
- Filter multipliers, self-filter selectivity, and rows-per-seek costing now
  consume generic constraint records. AST and HIR constraints therefore use
  the same formulas rather than parallel cost implementations.
- Index seek-benefit costing now consumes a physical table, generic
  constraints, and a covering-index decision. Index page-width and ANALYZE
  lookups no longer require `JoinedTable`; the legacy path supplies only a
  temporary covering-index adapter.
- Legacy and HIR join planning now share one builder for CROSS and outer-join
  ordering restrictions. Preserved HIR RIGHT JOIN is constrained directly;
  the HIR path does not need the parser-era source swap.
- Query-block planning input now comes directly from HIR. It preserves lexical
  source order and exact join kinds, splits resolved ON and WHERE conjunctions,
  and builds USING/NATURAL equality predicates from frozen column references
  and comparison rules without resolver, `TableReferences`, or parser-expression
  conversion.
- HIR planned sources retain `SourceId`, resolved index hints, HIR expressions,
  and string join names. Their construction no longer depends on
  `ProgramBuilder`, planner table-ID allocation, or parser index-hint nodes.
- HIR constraint collection consumes `HirPlannedSource` and the complete index
  metadata frozen on its HIR source. It no longer accepts `JoinedTable`,
  `AvailableIndexes`, or a separate source ID; existing candidate,
  expression-index, partial-index, selectivity, and automatic-index rules are
  shared with the legacy planner where they remain physical planning work.
- SELECT B-tree sources freeze every resolved ordinary, expression, and
  partial index in catalog order. Expression keys and predicates close over
  the exact `SourceId`; complete coverage lets HIR planning avoid rebinding
  schema AST when matching indexes.
- Analyzer-owned HIR arenas and mandatory document validation.
- Trigger `WHEN` predicates bind directly against event-shaped, qualified-only
  NEW/OLD pseudo-sources. Column types and rowid identity stay in HIR; invalid
  event-row references keep their existing diagnostics without rewriting AST
  nodes into positional variables.
- SELECT analysis receives one expression-policy bundle for all clauses,
  table-function arguments, CTEs, and nested queries. Trigger policy is applied
  when the bundle creates each clause policy, so callers do not consult
  semantic context again or lose NEW/OLD and RAISE rules in nested SELECTs.
- Trigger SELECT commands become ordinary query HIR carrying one trigger
  environment. NEW/OLD remain reserved qualified namespaces across every
  clause, CTE, and nested query, including LIMIT; no positional-variable AST
  rewrite is needed.
- Trigger INSERT commands become ordinary INSERT HIR carrying one trigger
  environment. Their target is resolved directly in the trigger database;
  VALUES, source queries, and UPSERT expressions share trigger expression
  policies, and outer conflict policy wins without cloning or rewriting AST.
- Trigger UPDATE commands become ordinary UPDATE HIR carrying one trigger
  environment. Inner changed-row sources remain distinct from outer trigger
  NEW/OLD sources; SET, FROM, derived queries, and WHERE share trigger policies,
  and the target plus conflict policy are resolved without AST rewriting.
- Trigger DELETE commands become ordinary DELETE HIR carrying one trigger
  environment. The inner target remains distinct from the outer OLD row;
  predicates and nested queries keep trigger policies, and the target resolves
  directly in the trigger database without AST rewriting.
- Trigger roots own their environment once and distinguish predicates from
  SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands with enums. Ordinary query and
  DML nodes no longer carry optional trigger-only state; validation receives
  trigger-command context from the root shape.
- Whole trigger programs bind their optional WHEN predicate and ordered command
  list in one analyzer. Every command reuses one NEW/OLD environment, statement
  conflict policy reaches INSERT and UPDATE without AST rewriting, and HIR
  validation visits the complete program.
- Semantic context owns one normalized database-name map, database-ID map, and
  explicit unqualified search path across main, temp, and attached schemas.
  Qualified tables and indexes keep their database identity; DML metadata uses
  the target database, and documents record sorted schema-version snapshots.
- A neutral semantic catalog captures `Arc` references to main, temp, attached,
  and connection-local staged schemas from the same inputs used to create the
  legacy resolver. It also captures the exact unqualified lookup order without
  holding catalog locks; the resolver neither creates nor owns this catalog.
- A standalone semantic entry point consumes that owned catalog and
  produces a validated statement or whole-trigger-program `HirDocument`.
  Trigger targets resolve inside the catalog from database ID and table name,
  so callers cannot inject an unrelated catalog table. Analysis borrows only
  catalog schemas, symbols, dialect, and semantic options; it imports no
  resolver or emitter types, and live resolver and locks are not needed.
- The defensive semantic path for parser-rejected `INSERT INTO t(a) DEFAULT
  VALUES` preserves the parser's `0 values for N columns` diagnostic.
- HIR scope with source, output-alias, database-qualified, outer-scope, rowid,
  USING/NATURAL merged-column, star-expansion, and collation rules.
- One ordinary table source and basic result outputs, including stars.
- Immutable AST-to-HIR binding for names, literals, unary and binary operators,
  null tests, parentheses, `COLLATE`, and SQL parameters.
- `LIKE`, `GLOB`, `REGEXP`, and `MATCH` expressions carry resolved function
  identity and argument count. Only `LIKE` accepts `ESCAPE`; row-valued left
  sides remain limited to `MATCH`.
- Iterative expression analysis, including deep-expression coverage.
- `BETWEEN`, list `IN`, `CASE`, and built-in `CAST` expressions.
- Row operands in binary comparisons, `BETWEEN`, and list `IN`. Iterative
  expression frames flatten only supported row positions; HIR keeps one
  comparison component per element with resolved affinity and collation, while
  width mismatches and scalar-only positions retain their existing errors.
- Multi-column UPDATE subqueries bind as one row-subquery assignment. Query
  output width is validated against target width, outputs receive destination
  types, correlated captures stay document-owned, and duplicate targets retain
  last-assignment-wins behavior through shared scalar output references.
- Row subqueries bind as single HIR operands in binary comparisons and
  `BETWEEN`. Iterative frames carry query identity plus output facts; width,
  affinity, and collation checks consume those facts without flattening query
  evaluation into separate scalar subqueries.
- Catalog-resolved custom `CAST` targets that need no stored program.
- Simple custom `CAST` encoders bound against document-owned synthetic inputs.
- Domain `NOT NULL` and `CHECK` rules frozen into custom `CAST` targets.
- Scalar function calls with resolved catalog identity, including calls inside
  custom `CAST` encoders.
- Plain aggregate calls with stable query-block identities and frozen result
  type facts. `COUNT(*)`, `DISTINCT`, argument `ORDER BY`, aggregate `FILTER`,
  and ordered-set forms are explicit in HIR; nested aggregates are rejected
  during analysis.
- Inline window calls with stable query-block identities, resolved partition
  and ordering expressions, and frozen effective frames. Aggregate window
  filters and built-in frame coercion keep their existing rules.
- Named and inherited windows resolve during analysis. Functions reference
  block-owned `WindowId` values; parser window names and inheritance links do
  not enter HIR.
- `RAISE(ABORT, ...)` expressions, including built-in custom-type encoders such
  as `VARCHAR`.
- Custom-type read functions. `union_tag`, `union_extract`, and
  `struct_extract` carry resolved types and stable member indexes in HIR.
- Direct and nested struct/union dot access resolves database and table names
  first, then freezes member kind, index, container type, and result type in
  HIR. Function and dot syntax share one member resolver.
- Sequence writes. `nextval` and `setval` carry the resolved sequence,
  backing table, and optional `sqlite_sequence` table. `currval` stays an
  ordinary scalar call because it only reads connection state.
- Basic joins. Comma, plain, inner, and cross joins preserve source order and
  bind `ON` expressions against the complete FROM scope.
- Table-valued functions become `SourceKind::TableFunction` sources with a
  resolved catalog table and bound HIR arguments. Arguments use the complete
  FROM scope, including forward references, while aggregate/window calls and
  excess hidden-column arguments keep their binding-time errors.
- `USING` and `NATURAL` joins resolve both column expressions once, freeze
  comparison rules in HIR, and expose one merged unqualified column while
  keeping qualified columns available.
- Left, right, and full joins remain in lexical source order. Merged columns
  select the left value, right value, or a fact-aware coalesced value according
  to the preserved join kind; no planner-era right-join swap enters HIR.
- Compound SELECT arms become ordered query blocks with separate source scopes,
  aggregate identities, and window identities. `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `EXCEPT`,
  and `INTERSECT` are preserved in HIR, while outward output identity stays with
  the first arm and width errors keep the existing diagnostic.
- Ordinary CTEs bind lazily from immutable AST references. Referenced CTEs own
  HIR queries and sources, forward sibling references and nested shadowing keep
  their existing rules, and unused invalid definitions never enter the closed
  document. Document-local `CteId` values are allocated on first use so the HIR
  arena contains no unreachable definitions.
- Derived `FROM` subqueries own child queries with lexical parents and become
  `SourceKind::Derived` sources. Derived sources and CTEs share the same
  first-arm output-to-column fact builder. Derived sources remain
  non-correlated at this checkpoint.
- Scalar and `EXISTS` expression subqueries own child queries with lexical
  parents. Outer names resolve through nested HIR scopes, scalar results keep
  the selected output facts, and each query derives its exact sorted capture
  set from completed HIR instead of mutable binding sidecars.
- Scalar and row-value `IN` query expressions keep the left expressions,
  negation, child query, and one frozen comparison rule per column in HIR.
  Correlated right sides capture outer sources, and row-width errors keep the
  existing diagnostic.
- `IN table` and `IN table(arguments)` normalize to the same membership-query
  HIR. The generated query selects visible source columns from a resolved
  table, CTE, or table function; arguments and CTE bodies keep exact captures.
- WHERE expressions become query-block filters. Source columns win over result
  aliases, aliases remain stable `OutputId` references, correlated subqueries
  keep their captures, and aggregate or window calls retain their existing
  errors.
- GROUP BY keys keep resolved expressions, type facts, and collations. Source
  columns win over aliases, positive integer terms become `OutputId` references,
  and grouping expressions cannot capture an enclosing query. HAVING prefers
  aliases, allows aggregates with block-local identities, and rejects windows.
- Query-level ORDER BY terms keep resolved expressions, direction, null order,
  type facts, and collations. Ordinary queries prefer output aliases, preserve
  output ordinals, correlated subqueries, and ORDER-BY-only function identities.
  Compound queries resolve ordinals and names from any arm to the first arm's
  stable `OutputId` values and keep their restricted-expression diagnostics.
- Query-level LIMIT and OFFSET expressions bind in an empty scalar scope. They
  keep parameters, scalar functions, DQS literals, and independent child
  queries while rejecting query names, correlation, aggregates, and windows.
  Both OFFSET spellings share the same normalized HIR shape.
- VALUES rows bind as block-owned HIR expressions. Generated `columnN` outputs
  keep first-row type, affinity, and collation facts; row expressions remain
  the only runtime values. VALUES subqueries keep outer captures, scalar DQS
  rules, aggregate/window identities, and compound-arm ordering.
- Recursive CTE seeds and recursive arms bind as separate HIR queries.
  Self-references become occurrence-local `RecursiveInput` sources, UNION
  operators and comparison collations stay explicit, and recursive
  aggregate/window and structure errors remain binding-time errors. Queue
  ORDER BY terms resolve to output positions with explicit collations, while
  LIMIT/OFFSET expressions use the same empty scalar scope as ordinary limits.
  Recursive-reference counting follows nested CTE scopes: shadowing definitions
  hide outer names, unused definitions contribute nothing, and referenced
  definitions contribute their body's recursive references. CTE queries nested
  in correlated subqueries inherit the enclosing query scope; recursive seeds
  and arms record exact outer-source captures while same-query sibling sources
  remain invisible.
- Built-in array table columns. `SourceColumn::type_fact` carries array rank and
  element type without adding semantic storage metadata beside the column.
- `ARRAY[...]`, `array(...)`, bracket subscripts, and `array_element(...)`
  normalize to dedicated array/subscript HIR. Constructors derive rank from
  their elements; typed column subscripts retain element type facts.
- Array utility calls keep resolved function identity and derive exact result
  categories. Mutators preserve or deepen array facts, concatenation merges
  ranks, shape-preserving calls retain declarations, and scalar utilities have
  fixed integer or text results.
- Custom binary operators freeze their two-argument function identity,
  direct-or-derived swap/negate behavior, and any literal encoder call. Same
  declared custom types and compatible literals use the operator; different
  types and incompatible literals keep normal SQL behavior.
- `INDEXED BY` resolves to a snapshot-bound index identity on the source, while
  `NOT INDEXED` remains an explicit source hint. Missing and wrong-table indexes
  fail during analysis.
- Custom-type table columns keep their resolved type chain and declaration
  parameters in HIR. Encode programs follow leaf-to-base order, decode programs
  reverse it, and custom arrays reuse element `TypeFact` without separate array
  storage metadata.
- Referenced virtual generated columns and short-record defaults become
  source-owned HIR expressions. A final required-column worklist follows
  generated-column dependencies transitively, while unused stored expressions
  remain `NotRequired`.
- Basic `INSERT ... VALUES` and `DEFAULT VALUES` statements become INSERT HIR.
  Target columns, duplicate-column write selection, rowid aliases, defaults,
  generated expressions, and row-width diagnostics are resolved during
  analysis.
- Scalar, EXISTS, and IN queries inside direct INSERT VALUES are root-owned
  queries with no INSERT-target scope or query parent. Their own FROM sources
  resolve normally, captures stay exact, and destination types remain attached
  to the containing VALUES expression.
- INSERT targets freeze every CHECK expression plus every ordinary,
  expression, and partial index in catalog order. Stable catalog identities
  and `IndexCoverage::Complete` make the required write metadata explicit.
- AUTOINCREMENT INSERT targets carry one `ResolvedAutoincrement` object with
  the resolved `sqlite_sequence` table and an optional MVCC sequence operation.
  The grouped shape cannot represent an allocator without its sequence table.
- INSERT trigger identities are grouped by the write that can fire them.
  Ordinary INSERT triggers keep catalog order; UPSERT UPDATE triggers include
  ordinary UPDATE triggers and matching `UPDATE OF` triggers. Trigger
  data-changing command programs and temp-schema catalog inputs remain later
  checkpoints.
- INSERT foreign keys freeze outgoing and incoming constraint identities,
  resolved child and parent positions, rowid or UNIQUE-index parent lookup,
  and the exact child scan source. Incoming generated child keys close their
  stored expressions against that scan source. Enforcement remains outside
  semantic analysis.
- INSERT target metadata is split by storage kind. B-tree targets own defaults,
  AUTOINCREMENT, triggers, and foreign keys; virtual targets cannot represent
  any of those fields and retain the existing VALUES or DEFAULT VALUES source
  rule.
- Plain `INSERT ... SELECT` sources retain their query identity and complete
  SELECT HIR. Destination width is checked during analysis, and nested query
  captures remain attached to the source query tree.
- Top-level INSERT WITH clauses use one lazy CTE scope across query sources,
  inline VALUES, UPSERT expressions, and RETURNING. Referenced ordinary and
  recursive CTEs enter the closed document, unused invalid definitions remain
  unbound, and failed analysis always removes the statement scope.
- Statement-level INSERT conflict resolution remains an exact parser enum in
  HIR, distinguishing ROLLBACK, ABORT, FAIL, IGNORE, REPLACE, and no override.
- Direct INSERT values and defaults carry their destination type through the
  iterative expression frames. `union_value` freezes the destination union and
  tag in HIR, and its value argument receives the selected variant type,
  including for nested unions.
- INSERT-SELECT passes destination types by output position into every SELECT
  and VALUES compound arm. Destination-aware functions therefore resolve the
  same way in direct VALUES and query sources without changing standalone
  SELECT rules.
- Simple INSERT VALUES sources stay as inline rows. Compound VALUES and VALUES
  with query-level decorations use query HIR, preserving compound blocks,
  ORDER BY/LIMIT, width checks, and destination types in every arm.
- Scalar INSERT RETURNING expressions bind against the target source and become
  root-owned HIR outputs. Unqualified and qualified stars, aliases, type facts,
  affinities, collations, and generated-column dependencies are resolved during
  analysis.
- RETURNING scalar, EXISTS, and IN subqueries are root-owned queries with no
  query parent and exact captures of the INSERT target. Query-owned expressions
  keep their lexical parent. INSERT-level WITH scopes remain alive through
  RETURNING so lazy CTE definitions keep one statement-local identity.
- Catch-all `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` clauses become ordered INSERT HIR without
  creating an EXCLUDED source.
- Targeted `DO NOTHING` clauses freeze bound conflict expressions, explicit
  collations, sort order, partial-index predicates, and the exact PRIMARY KEY
  or UNIQUE index match. Chained clauses retain parser order. `DO UPDATE`
  actions bind assignments and predicates against the current target row plus
  one root-owned, qualified-only EXCLUDED pseudo-source. Row assignments,
  duplicate targets, generated-column checks, destination types, and existing
  subquery restrictions keep their binding rules.
- Basic B-tree UPDATE statements become UPDATE HIR with distinct OLD table and
  NEW pseudo-source identities. SET and WHERE expressions read OLD values;
  generated columns, defaults, CHECK constraints, and complete index metadata
  close separately against both row identities. Row assignments, duplicate
  targets, rowid aliases, SET DEFAULT, array-setter composition, destination
  types, and correlated expression subqueries keep their binding rules. WITHOUT
  ROWID targets retain their existing unsupported diagnostic.
- UPDATE trigger identities retain catalog order and include ordinary UPDATE
  triggers plus only the `UPDATE OF` triggers whose named columns are assigned.
  Trigger data-changing command programs remain a later checkpoint.
- UPDATE foreign keys freeze outgoing constraints against the NEW row source
  and incoming constraints against separate child-table scan sources. Parent
  identities, column positions, UNIQUE indexes, and generated child keys use
  the same closed metadata as INSERT. Enforcement remains outside semantic
  analysis.
- UPDATE RETURNING expressions bind against the NEW row identity. Stars,
  output facts, aliases, collations, generated columns, and root-owned
  subqueries share INSERT's DML RETURNING path. The base table name remains
  visible when the UPDATE target has an alias; that alias is not visible.
- SELECT, INSERT, recursive CTE bodies, and UPDATE use one scoped CTE helper,
  which removes the statement scope on success or error and checks that nested
  analysis did not leak another scope. UPDATE WITH definitions remain lazy,
  reach SET, WHERE, and RETURNING subqueries, support recursive bodies, and do
  not shadow the catalog UPDATE target.
- UPDATE FROM reuses the SELECT source analyzer with root ownership. JOIN
  constraints see only FROM sources; SET and WHERE see the target and FROM at
  one resolution level; RETURNING still sees only the NEW target row. CTE and
  derived sources keep their resolved identities, and every root expression
  read participates in stored-column metadata closure.
- UPDATE target metadata is split by storage kind. B-tree targets own defaults,
  triggers, foreign keys, CHECKs, and complete index metadata; virtual targets
  cannot represent those fields. Virtual SET, WHERE, FROM, RETURNING, aliases,
  and rowid expressions use the ordinary UPDATE binding rules.
- Basic B-tree DELETE statements become DELETE HIR with one resolved target
  source. WHERE expressions use the target scope, including aliases, rowid,
  and correlated subqueries. Generated-column reads and every ordinary,
  expression, and partial index close against that target; `INDEXED BY` keeps
  its resolved catalog identity. Target metadata is split between B-tree and
  virtual variants from the start. WITHOUT ROWID targets keep their existing
  unsupported diagnostic.
- DELETE trigger identities retain catalog order and include only DELETE
  triggers for the target database. Trigger data-changing command programs
  remain a later checkpoint.
- DELETE foreign keys freeze outgoing constraints against the deleted target
  row and incoming constraints against separate child-table scan sources.
  Parent identities, column positions, UNIQUE indexes, and generated child keys
  use the same closed metadata as INSERT and UPDATE. Enforcement remains
  outside semantic analysis.
- DELETE RETURNING expressions bind against the deleted target row. Stars,
  target aliases, rowid, output facts, collations, generated columns, and
  root-owned subqueries retain the same resolved HIR rules as other DML
  RETURNING clauses.
- DELETE uses the shared scoped CTE helper across WHERE and RETURNING. Ordinary
  and recursive definitions bind lazily, unused invalid definitions remain
  absent, and a CTE named like the target does not shadow the catalog DELETE
  destination. The statement scope is removed on success or error.
- Virtual-table DELETE targets use the virtual metadata variant and cannot
  carry B-tree indexes, CHECKs, triggers, or foreign keys. WHERE, RETURNING,
  aliases, rowid, and WITH subqueries retain the ordinary DELETE binding rules.

The completed standalone SELECT expression checkpoints cover scalar
expressions, row and row-subquery operands in comparisons and `BETWEEN`, list
and query `IN`, and `MATCH`. `union_value` is resolved only in
destination-aware DML expressions.

Standalone HIR lowering now also covers query `IN` probes. `QueryId` maps to
the ephemeral index cursor owned by query lowering; the probe uses the frozen
comparison affinity and collation. Its true, false, and NULL branches retain
the legacy opcode flow, including checking each row-value operand for NULL
before evaluating the next operand.

The supported SELECT path now reaches ordinary non-recursive CTEs, derived
`FROM` sources, and parenthesized FROM groups, plus correlated scalar, `EXISTS`,
and `IN` query expressions. FROM groups preserve their nested joins, merged
column order, aliases, unaliased inner qualifiers, CTE reachability, and source
ownership without inventing a query. WHERE filters, GROUP BY keys, HAVING
predicates, query-level ORDER BY terms, and LIMIT/OFFSET and VALUES rows are
also bound. Recursive CTE core identity, arms, queue ORDER BY, LIMIT/OFFSET,
and nested CTE identity are bound. Correlation with enclosing queries is also
bound for ordinary and recursive CTE queries.

Scalar calls now deliberately normalize production-only syntax before entering
HIR. `DISTINCT` is discarded after its arguments are bound, and a `FILTER`
expression is bound but does not change scalar evaluation. Supported nullary
`function(*)` calls become zero-argument calls, and JSON object star calls
expand to name/value arguments from the visible source columns. Argument
`ORDER BY`, scalar `OVER`, unsupported star syntax, and wrong arity retain
their existing diagnostics. Aggregate and window metadata are unchanged.

Custom CAST targets now use ordinary affinity CAST rules when their supplied
parameter count does not match the resolved custom type. Correctly
parameterized custom array targets retain their frozen custom type chain,
schema programs, and array dimensions in HIR.

Stored custom-type programs now treat parameter disagreement inside a resolved
type chain as a catalog invariant error. User-visible CAST arity fallback is
handled before schema-program binding, so this internal path no longer reports
unsupported SELECT.

## Working rules

- Keep existing binding rules and diagnostics.
- Keep parser AST immutable; expression binding returns HIR.
- Successful analysis must produce a closed document that passes
  `HirDocument::validate()`.
- Prefer narrow vertical checkpoints over mechanically translating old binder
  modules.
- Before each code checkpoint, show the proposed shape and obtain approval.
- Test and commit each approved checkpoint separately with `jj`.
- Tests should assert resolved HIR and document validity, not AST mutation or
  `TableReferences` sidecars.
